/*Coding Challenge #2
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
improve it.
Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
Hint: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€ 


// let markMass = 78;
// let markHeight = 1.69;
// let johnMass = 92;
// let johnHeight = 1.95;

//Data 2;
let markMass = 95;
let markHeight = 1.88;
let johnMass = 85;
let johnHeight = 1.76;


//Using both formulas
const BMIMark = markMass / markHeight ** 2;
const BMIJohn = johnMass / (johnHeight * johnHeight);

//Boolean Variable
const markHigherBMI = BMIMark > BMIJohn;
console.log(BMIMark, BMIJohn, markHigherBMI)

if(markHigherBMI >= true){
console.log(`Mark's (BMI ${BMIMark}) is higher than John's (${BMIJohn})!`)
} else {
    console.log(`John's BMI (${BMIJohn}) is higher than Mark's (${BMIMark})!`)
};
